## Question 01

# Since the true variance is unknown and sample size is less than 30,
# we can apply one sample t-test.
# Hypothesis: H0: u = 3 Vs H1: u = 3
# Consider 5% level of significance
# To run the one-sample t test, "t.test" command can be used as follows.

x<-c(3, 7, 11, 0, 7, 0, 4, 5, 6, 2)
t.test(x, mu = 3)

# P value approach will be used to get the conclusion of hypothesis testing.
# Conclusion: Since p value (0.2012) is greater than 0.05, do not reject H0 at 5% level of significance. 
# Therefore, we can conclude that the true average number of memes that professors know is not 
# significantly different from 3 (exactly equal to 3).





## Question 02

# Part 1

# Since the true variance is unknown and sample size is less than 30,
# we can apply one sample t-test.
# Hypothesis: H0: μ >= 25 Vs H1: μ < 25
# Consider 5% level of significance
# To run the one-sample t test, "t.test" command can be used as follows.

Weight <- c(17.6, 20.6, 22.2, 15.3, 20.9, 21.0, 18.9, 18.9, 18.9, 18.2)
t.test(Weight, mu=25, alternative="less")

# P value approach will be used to get the conclusion of hypothesis testing.
# Conclusion: Since p value (3.977e-06) is less than 0.05, reject H0 at 5% level of significance.
# Therefore, we can conclude that the true mean weight of mice is significantly less than 25 grams.



# Part 2
# To obtain each value separately, we need to store the results of the hypothesis testing into a variable. 
# Accordingly, results were stored into "res" variable.
res <- t.test(Weight, mu=25, alternative="less")

# To extract test statistic, use "res$statistic" command as follows.
res$statistic

# To extract p value for the test, use "res$p.value" command as follows.
res$p.value

# To extract confidence interval for the test, use "res$conf.int" command as follows.
res$conf.int





## Question 03

# Part 1

# To generate random numbers from a Normal distribution, we can use "rnorm" command as follows.
y <- rnorm(30, mean = 9.8, sd = 0.05)


# Part 2

# Since the true variance is known we can apply one sample z-test.
# Hypothesis: H0: μ <= 10 Vs H1: μ > 10
# Consider 5% level of significance
# To run the one-sample z test, "t.test" command can be used as follows.
# When samples are large enough, t distribution can be approximated into Normal distribution.
# So that same command ("t.test") can be used for one sample z test.

t.test(y, mu=10, alternative="greater")

# P value approach will be used to get the conclusion of hypothesis testing.
# Conclusion: Since p value (1) is greater than 0.05, do not reject H0 at 5% level of significance. 
# Therefore, we can conclude that the true mean sugar level of a cookie is less than or equal to 10.
# Note that based on the random numbers you got as the sample, results of the test will be different.
